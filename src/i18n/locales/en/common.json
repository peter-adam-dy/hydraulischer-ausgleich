    "clickForMore": "Click for more details",
    "designOutdoorTemp": "The design outdoor temperature is not the current or average temperature, but the statistically coldest temperature at your location (occurs roughly every 20 years). The heating system is sized so that it still provides sufficient heat even during this extreme cold.",
    "ageClass": "The building age class determines how well your building is insulated. Older buildings have thinner walls and worse windows, so more heat is lost. The class automatically sets typical insulation values (U-values) for your walls, windows, etc.",
    "climateZone": "Select the nearest city. The location determines the design outdoor temperature, i.e. how cold it can get in winter. Munich gets colder than Cologne, for example.",
    "buildingType": "The building type affects how many exterior walls lose heat. An apartment has fewer exterior walls than a detached house.",
    "uValue": "The U-value (thermal transmittance) indicates how much heat escapes through a building component. The lower the value, the better the insulation.\n\nUnit: W/(m²·K) = Watts per square meter per degree temperature difference\n\nExamples:\n• Old exterior wall (pre-1978): approx. 1.4\n• Modern exterior wall (post-2016): approx. 0.2\n• Old window (single glazing): approx. 2.8\n• Modern window (triple): approx. 0.95",
    "components": "Building components describe the thermal envelope of your room — all surfaces through which heat can escape to the outside or to colder adjacent rooms.\n\nAdd all exterior walls (with windows), ceilings/floors adjacent to unheated areas, and interior walls to significantly colder rooms.",
    "componentTypes": "• Exterior wall: Wall facing directly outside\n• Interior wall: Wall to another room (only needed if the adjacent room is significantly colder, e.g. stairwell)\n• Roof/upper ceiling: Only relevant on the top floor\n• Floor: To ground or unheated basement\n• Intermediate ceiling: Ceiling to unheated attic",
    "adjacentTemp": "The temperature on the other side of the wall. For interior walls to a stairwell, e.g. approx. 10–15 °C, for walls to an unheated basement approx. 5–10 °C.\n\nFor exterior walls, the design outdoor temperature is used automatically.",
    "windowInComponent": "Windows are calculated separately from the wall because they have a different U-value (usually worse than insulated walls). The window area is automatically subtracted from the wall area.",
    "airChangeRate": "The air change rate indicates how many times the entire room air is exchanged per hour — through ventilation, air leakage, and ventilation systems.\n\n• 0.3: Very airtight building, minimal ventilation\n• 0.5: Normal (living/bedrooms)\n• 1.0: Kitchen/WC (more moisture)\n• 1.5: Bathroom (frequent ventilation)\n\nEach air exchange means: cold air comes in, warm air goes out → the heating must compensate.",
    "floorPosition": "The position in the building affects heat losses:\n• Basement: Losses through the floor to the ground\n• Ground floor: Losses through the floor to basement/ground\n• Upper floor: Typically only exterior wall losses\n• Top floor: Additional losses through the roof area",
    "desiredTemp": "Your desired temperature for this room. Common values:\n• Living room: 20–22 °C\n• Bedroom: 16–18 °C\n• Bathroom: 22–24 °C\n• Kitchen: 18–20 °C\n\nHigher temperatures mean higher energy demand.",
    "transmissionLoss": "Transmission loss is the heat that escapes through walls, windows, roof, and floor to the outside. The worse the insulation (higher U-value) and the larger the area, the more heat is lost.",
    "ventilationLoss": "Ventilation loss occurs from the exchange of warm room air with cold outside air. It depends on the room volume and air change rate.",
    "heatingLoad": "The heating load is the thermal power (in Watts) that your radiator must deliver to maintain the desired temperature — even on the coldest day of the year. It consists of transmission and ventilation losses.",
    "radiatorType": "The type designation describes the construction of the radiator:\n\n• Type 10: 1 panel, no convector fins — flat, low output\n• Type 11: 1 panel, 1 convector fin — standard\n• Type 20: 2 panels, no convector fins\n• Type 21: 2 panels, 1 convector fin — very common\n• Type 22: 2 panels, 2 convector fins — the most common type\n• Type 33: 3 panels, 3 convector fins — maximum output, very deep\n\nThe first digit = number of panels, the second = number of convector fins. More panels and fins = more heating power at the same size.\n\nTip: Look at your radiator from the side to count the panels.",
    "ratedOutput": "The rated output (ΔT50) is the heating power under standardized test conditions: at a temperature difference of 50°C between radiator and room (e.g. supply 90°C, return 70°C, room 20°C).\n\nIn practice, most systems operate at lower temperatures, so the actual output is lower than the rated output.",
    "actualOutput": "The actual output shows how much heat the radiator delivers at your actual system temperatures (supply/return). This is usually significantly lower than the rated output, as modern heating systems operate at lower temperatures.",
    "supplyTemp": "The supply temperature is the temperature of the hot water flowing from the boiler to the radiator. Typical values:\n• Old heating: 70–80 °C\n• Modern condensing boiler: 55–65 °C\n• Heat pump: 35–45 °C\n\nYou can find the value on your heating controller or the thermometer on the supply pipe.",
    "returnTemp": "The return temperature is the temperature of the cooled water flowing back from the radiator to the boiler. It is always lower than the supply temperature.\n\nThe difference (spread) is typically 10–20 K.",
    "spread": "The spread is the temperature difference between supply and return. Typically 15 K (e.g. 70/55 °C). A larger spread means the radiator extracts more heat from the water.",
    "valveType": "The default valve type applies to all radiators unless individually overridden. Check the marking on the valve bottom part (under the thermostatic head).\n\nIf unsure, \"Danfoss RA-N\" is the most common choice for German apartment heating systems.",
    "radiatorValve": "Here you can set the valve type and DN size for this radiator individually, if it differs from the system default.\n\nThe system default is set in the system settings and applies to all radiators that don't have their own valve type.",
    "valveDn": "The DN size (nominal diameter) is the connection diameter of the valve. Common values:\n• DN10: Small radiators, towel dryers\n• DN15: Standard for most radiators\n• DN20: Large radiators, high flow\n\nCheck the marking on the valve body or measure the connection.",
    "specificPressureLoss": "The specific pressure loss describes the flow resistance in the heating pipes per meter of length. The default value of 120 Pa/m is suitable for most apartment heating systems.\n\nOnly change this value if you know the actual pipe dimensions.",
    "circuit": "A heating circuit is a group of radiators connected to the same pipe run. In an apartment heating system, you usually have only one circuit.\n\nIf your radiators are connected to different riser pipes, create multiple circuits.",
    "pipeLength": "The pipe length is the estimated distance from the boiler/manifold to the radiator and back (supply and return pipe combined).\n\nEstimate the length along the actual pipe routing — through walls, under floors, etc. For a typical apartment, it's approx. 5–20 m per radiator.",
    "flowRate": "The flow rate indicates how much water per hour must flow through the radiator to transport the required heat. Unit: liters per hour (L/h).",
    "kvValue": "The Kv value is a measure of the flow rate a valve allows at a given pressure difference. It is calculated and then compared with the valve table to find the correct preset.",
    "valvePreset": "The preset is the number/setting to which you must adjust the valve on your radiator. It limits the water flow so that each radiator receives exactly the right amount of water.\n\nThe setting is made on the valve body (under the thermostatic head), usually with a special key or pliers.",
    "criticalRadiator": "The most unfavorable radiator is the one with the highest pressure loss — i.e. the one furthest from the boiler or requiring the most flow. It determines the required pump capacity.",
    "coverageStatus": "• Undersupplied (< 90%): The radiator cannot sufficiently heat the room on the coldest day. Consider installing a larger radiator.\n• Adequate (90–110%): Good fit — the radiator covers the demand.\n• Oversupplied (> 110%): The radiator is oversized. No problem, but the preset will throttle the flow down."
